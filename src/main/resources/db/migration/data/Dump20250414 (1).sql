They were the last people you‚Äôd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn‚Äôt hold with such nonsense.\n\nMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\n\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn‚Äôt think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley‚Äôs sister, but they hadn‚Äôt met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn‚Äôt have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn‚Äôt want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\n\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.',_binary 'UÑ\0\‚õA‘ßDfUD\0\0','Chapter 1: The Boy Who Lived'),(_binary '>Eg\Ëõ”§VBf@',2,'None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\n\nAt half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. ‚ÄúLittle tyke,‚Äù chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four‚Äôs drive.\n\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar ‚Äî a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn‚Äôt realize what he had seen ‚Äî then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn‚Äôt a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive ‚Äî no, looking at the sign; cats couldn‚Äôt read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\n\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else.

Mr. Dursley couldn‚Äôt bear people who dressed in funny clothes ‚Äî the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren‚Äôt young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak!

Hobbits are quiet folk, fond of good food and comfort, and Bilbo was no exception ‚Äî or so it seemed. But there was something odd about him, ever since his adventure long ago. He had come back to Bag End with more gold than any hobbit could dream of, and stories of dragons and wizards that no one quite believed. Most thought he was just a bit touched in the head, but harmless enough. Still, his parties were the talk of Hobbiton, grand affairs with fireworks and gifts for everyone, and folk forgave his oddities for the sake of his generosity.\n\nFrodo Baggins, Bilbo‚Äôs young cousin and heir, was different. He was quieter, more thoughtful, and had a look in his eyes that made you think he saw things others didn‚Äôt. The older hobbits shook their heads and said he took after Bilbo too much. Frodo kept to himself mostly, except for a few close friends, and he loved nothing better than wandering the Shire‚Äôs green hills, often at night under the stars. There was talk that he was planning something for his fiftieth birthday, something to rival Bilbo‚Äôs great feast, but no one knew what.\n\nIn Bag End, life went on much as it always had. Bilbo, now well over a hundred, showed no signs of slowing down. He still looked as spry as he had at sixty, which was queer, even for a hobbit. Folk whispered about that, too, but Bilbo just laughed and said good food and a merry heart kept him young. Frodo, though, noticed things ‚Äî how Bilbo would sometimes clutch at a plain gold ring in his pocket, or mutter to himself when he thought no one was listening. There was a restlessness in him, a shadow that hadn‚Äôt been there before.\n\nOne spring morning, as the Shire bloomed with new flowers, Gandalf the wizard came knocking at Bag End. Hobbits didn‚Äôt much care for wizards ‚Äî too much trouble, and far too unpredictable ‚Äî but Bilbo always welcomed him. Frodo, too, had a fondness for the old man, with his pointed hat and stories of far-off lands. This time, though, Gandalf‚Äôs face was grave, and his voice held a note of urgency that made Frodo‚Äôs heart skip.

The farmhouse stood proud against the Prince Edward Island sky, its white walls gleaming under the sun. Anne, now sixteen and taller than Marilla ever thought she‚Äôd grow, was curled up in her gable room, a book in her lap and her red hair spilling over her shoulders. She was supposed to be studying for her exams, but her mind was elsewhere, dreaming of poetry and adventure.\n\nDownstairs, Marilla Cuthbert was kneading dough with her usual brisk efficiency, her thoughts on practical matters ‚Äî the preserves that needed making, the cow that wasn‚Äôt giving enough milk. Matthew, as always, was out in the fields, his quiet presence a comfort to them both. The years since Anne‚Äôs arrival had changed Green Gables in ways Marilla could hardly believe. The girl‚Äôs chatter had filled the house with life, and though Marilla would never admit it, she‚Äôd grown fond of Anne‚Äôs wild imagination.\n\nThat morning, a letter arrived, its envelope crisp and official-looking. Marilla frowned as she set it on the table, wondering who could be writing to them. Anne, bounding down the stairs with her usual energy, spotted it at once. Her grey-green eyes lit up with curiosity, and before Marilla could protest, she‚Äôd torn it open. The words inside made her gasp ‚Äî it was from Queen‚Äôs Academy, offering her a place in their teaching program. Anne‚Äôs dreams of becoming a teacher, of shaping young minds with stories and ideas, seemed suddenly within reach.\n\nBut there was something else in the letter, something that made Anne‚Äôs heart race. A scholarship, it said, but only if she could leave Green Gables by summer‚Äôs end. Anne looked at Marilla, her face a mix of joy and fear. Green Gables was her home, the first place she‚Äôd ever belonged. Could she leave it behind, even for her dreams? Marilla, seeing the struggle in Anne‚Äôs eyes, felt a pang of her own.

She wandered out to the orchard, where the apple trees were heavy with blossoms, and sat beneath her favorite one, the Snow Queen. The beauty of Green Gables had always soothed her, but now it felt like a weight, pulling her heart in two directions. She loved this place ‚Äî the fields, the brook, the way the light slanted through the trees at dusk. But she also loved the idea of Queen‚Äôs, of classrooms filled with eager students, of proving she was more than just a dreamy girl with too many words.\n\nBack at the house, Marilla was wrestling with her own thoughts. She‚Äôd always been practical, focused on what needed doing, but Anne had changed her. The girl had brought color to her life, and the thought of Green Gables without her was unbearable. Yet Marilla knew Anne‚Äôs spirit was too big for their little farm. She deserved a chance to shine, even if it meant letting her go.\n\nThat evening, Matthew came in from the fields, his boots muddy and his face tired but kind. Anne showed him the letter, her voice trembling as she read it aloud. Matthew listened in silence, as he always did, but when she finished, he put a hand on her shoulder. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll know what‚Äôs right, Anne,‚Äù he said softly. It wasn‚Äôt much, but coming from Matthew, it was everything.\n\nBy nightfall, Anne still hadn‚Äôt decided. She sat by her window, looking out at the stars, and whispered a prayer for guidance.

Ross Poldark rode his horse along the narrow path, his dark eyes fixed on the horizon. He‚Äôd been away for years, fighting in a war that had left him scarred in ways no one could see. Now, returning to Nampara, his family‚Äôs home, he felt like a stranger in his own land.\n\nThe house was smaller than he remembered, its stone walls weathered by salt and wind. His father was gone, dead these past six months, and the estate was in ruins. Ross dismounted, his boots sinking into the muddy yard, and pushed open the door. Inside, the air was stale, the furniture covered in dust. Jud and Prudie, the servants, were sprawled by the fire, drunk and useless. Ross‚Äôs temper flared, but he held it in check. There was work to be done, and he‚Äôd never been one to shy away from it.\n\nOutside, the sea roared, a constant reminder of Cornwall‚Äôs wild heart. Ross walked to the cliff‚Äôs edge, his cloak snapping in the wind. He thought of Elizabeth, the woman he‚Äôd loved before the war. She‚Äôd promised to wait, but word had reached him in America that she was engaged to his cousin, Francis. The betrayal cut deeper than any wound he‚Äôd taken in battle, but Ross was not a man to dwell on what couldn‚Äôt be changed.\n\nAs the sun dipped below the waves, painting the sky in shades of fire, Ross made a vow. He would rebuild Nampara, not just for himself, but for the people of Cornwall who looked to the Poldarks for hope. The mines were failing, the tenants starving, but he‚Äôd find a way. With the sea at his back and the land beneath his feet, Ross Poldark was home, and he would fight for it.',_binary 'UÑ\0\‚õA‘ßDfUD\0','Chapter 1: The Sound of the Sea'),(_binary '>Eg\Ëõ”§VBf@',2,'Ross spent the next morning surveying the damage at Nampara. The fields were overgrown, the barns half-collapsed, and the mine his father had staked so much on was little more than a crumbling pit. Jud and Prudie, roused from their stupor, grumbled as they set about cleaning the house, but Ross paid them no mind. His thoughts were on the future, on what could be salvaged from this wreck.\n\nBy noon, he rode to Trenwith, the grand house where his uncle Charles lived with Francis and Elizabeth. The contrast to Nampara was stark ‚Äî polished floors, gleaming silver, servants who moved with quiet efficiency. Charles greeted him warmly, his face ruddy from too much wine, but Ross‚Äôs eyes were on Elizabeth. She stood by the window, her beauty unchanged, though her smile was hesitant. Francis, beside her, clapped Ross on the shoulder, oblivious to the tension.\n\nThe conversation turned to the war, the mines, the state of Cornwall. Ross listened, but his heart wasn‚Äôt in it. Elizabeth‚Äôs presence was a reminder of what he‚Äôd lost, and Francis‚Äôs easy confidence grated on him. When Charles mentioned the failing Wheal Leisure mine, Ross seized the chance to change the subject. He proposed reopening it, a risky venture, but one that could bring work to the starving miners. Charles laughed it off, but Ross saw a spark of interest in Elizabeth‚Äôs eyes.\n\nAs he rode back to Nampara, the wind carried the tang of salt and the distant cry of gulls. Ross felt the weight of his decision settling on him. Rebuilding Nampara was one thing; taking on a mine was another.

Jane Eyre sat by the window, her small hands folded in her lap, her grey eyes taking in the rolling moors of Yorkshire. She was no stranger to hardship ‚Äî her childhood at Gateshead and Lowood had seen to that ‚Äî but this journey to Thornfield Hall felt like a new beginning, or perhaps a test she wasn‚Äôt sure she could pass.\n\nThornfield was grander than she‚Äôd expected, a sprawling manor with ivy-clad walls and tall chimneys that pierced the sky. Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, welcomed her warmly, her chatter a stark contrast to the silence Jane was used to. She was to be governess to a young French girl, Ad√®le, the ward of Mr. Rochester, the manor‚Äôs absent master. Jane‚Äôs room was small but cozy, with a view of the gardens, and for the first time in years, she felt a flicker of hope.\n\nThat night, as she unpacked her few belongings, Jane heard a strange laugh echo through the halls ‚Äî sharp, mirthless, and gone as quickly as it came. Mrs. Fairfax brushed it off as a servant‚Äôs quirk, but Jane wasn‚Äôt convinced. There was something about Thornfield, a shadow beneath its polished surface, that set her nerves on edge. She pushed the thought aside, reminding herself of her place. She was here to teach, to earn her keep, nothing more.\n\nThe next morning, Jane met Ad√®le, a lively child with a love for dancing and a tendency to chatter in French. Teaching her would be a challenge, but Jane welcomed it. As she walked the grounds that evening, the moors stretching endless and wild before her, she felt a pull she couldn‚Äôt name. Thornfield was more than a house, she realized ‚Äî it was a story, and she was only beginning to read its pages.',_binary 'UÑ\0\‚õA‘ßDfUD\0','Chapter 1: The Arrival'),(_binary '>Eg\Ëõ”§VBf@',2,'Ad√®le proved to be both a delight and a trial. Her energy was boundless, her moods as changeable as the Yorkshire weather. Jane, patient but firm, began to find a rhythm, teaching her letters and numbers between bursts of song and dance. Mrs. Fairfax watched with approval, her kindness making Jane feel almost at home. Yet the strange laugh haunted her, heard again late at night, always from the upper floors where no one seemed to go.\n\nOne afternoon, as Jane sketched in the garden, a rider approached ‚Äî a man, tall and broad-shouldered, with a face both stern and striking. His horse stumbled, and he fell, cursing loudly. Jane, without thinking, ran to help. He eyed her with a mix of surprise and amusement, his dark gaze piercing. This, she learned, was Mr. Rochester, and his presence changed Thornfield in ways she couldn‚Äôt have foreseen.\n\nRochester was not like other men Jane had known. He spoke plainly, sometimes brusquely, but there was a depth to him, a restlessness that mirrored her own. That evening, he summoned her to the library, questioning her about her past, her thoughts, her very soul. Jane answered honestly, unafraid, and saw something shift in his eyes ‚Äî respect, perhaps, or something more dangerous.\n\nAs she lay in bed that night, the house quiet save for the wind rattling the windows, Jane felt a stir of unease. Rochester was a puzzle, Thornfield a mystery, and she was caught in the middle.

Lockwood, a gentleman seeking solitude after a failed romance, had rented Thrushcross Grange nearby, but curiosity drew him to visit his landlord, Heathcliff, at the Heights. The house was as unwelcoming as its master ‚Äî dark, cold, and filled with an air of suppressed violence.\n\nHeathcliff was a man of few words, his swarthy face etched with bitterness. His housekeeper, Zillah, moved silently, her eyes wary, while a young woman, pale and restless, barely acknowledged Lockwood‚Äôs presence. A hulking youth, Hareton, glared from the corner, his rough manners at odds with the faint trace of refinement in his features. Lockwood, puzzled by the strange household, tried to make conversation, but Heathcliff‚Äôs curt replies shut him down.\n\nAs a storm rolled in, Lockwood was forced to stay the night. The spare room was drafty, its window rattling under the wind‚Äôs assault. On a shelf, he found a diary, its pages filled with the scrawl of a girl named Catherine. The words spoke of love and pain, of a boy named Heathcliff who‚Äôd been her world. Disturbed, Lockwood drifted into uneasy sleep, only to wake to a tapping at the window ‚Äî a sound that grew into a chilling wail, as if a lost soul begged to be let in.\n\nBy morning, Lockwood was eager to leave. Heathcliff‚Äôs mood was darker than ever, and the young woman‚Äôs eyes held a flicker of defiance that unnerved him.

Mrs. Bennet, mother of five daughters, was determined that one of them would catch him, and her excitement filled the house with plans and schemes.\n\nElizabeth Bennet, the second eldest, cared little for her mother‚Äôs matchmaking. Quick-witted and independent, she preferred books and long walks to the marriage market. Her elder sister, Jane, was gentler, her beauty matched by a kindness that won everyone‚Äôs heart.

I paced, my breath fogging in the dim light, and thought of my parents, dead before I could know them. I had no one, yet in that moment, I swore I‚Äôd find a way to be free. The shadows grew longer, and a strange noise ‚Äî a creak, a whisper ‚Äî made my heart race. Was it a ghost, as Bess had warned, or just the house settling? I didn‚Äôt know, but I refused to cry.\n\nBy the time they let me out, my body was trembling, but my eyes were dry. Aunt Reed thought she‚Äôd tamed me, but she was wrong. The red room hadn‚Äôt broken me ‚Äî it had forged me. I was Jane Eyre, and one day, I‚Äôd make my own path, far from Gateshead‚Äôs walls.',_binary 'UÑ\0\‚õA‘ßDfUD\0','Chapter 1: The Red Room'),(_binary '>Eg\Ëõ”§VBf@\r',1,'Chapter 1: Down the Rabbit-Hole\n\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, ‚Äúand what is the use of a book,‚Äù thought Alice, ‚Äúwithout pictures or conversations?‚Äù\n\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\n\nThere was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ‚ÄúOh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!‚Äù (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.',_binary 'UÑ\0\‚õA‘ßDfUD\0	','Chapter 1: Down the Rabbit-Hole');
